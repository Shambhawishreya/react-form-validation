# SignUp Form with React

This project implements a SignUp form using React, allowing users to input their personal details and validating them before submission. The form includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Username, Email Address, Password, Password Confirmation, Phone Number, Country, City, PAN Number, and Aadhar Number.

## Features

- **Form Validation:** Validates each input field to ensure that required fields are filled and that data formats are correct (e.g., email format, password requirements).
- **Conditional Rendering:** Displays error messages for invalid inputs and shows user details upon successful submission.
- **Password Show/Hide:** Allows users to toggle password visibility for enhanced security.
- **Dropdown Selection:** Implements dropdown menus for selecting the country and city, with validation for selection.
- **Phone Number Format:** Requires a country code and a space between the country code and the 10-digit phone number.
- **Error Handling:** Provides clear error messages for each field and disables form submission until all fields are correctly filled.
